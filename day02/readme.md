### Day 2: Inventory Management System

#### Part one
Another one that requires counting of elements. Considering this one has known
number of possible elements ie. letters in english alphabet which are easily
addressable using ASCII codes, I used an array in this example.

#### Part two
Spent way too much time trying to figure out how to do this in non exponential
time constraint. In the end I gave up and went straight forward.
But I'm sure I see trees of green here. No roses though.
