### Day 6: Chronal Coordinates

#### Part one
At first I wanted to figure out a way to do this quickly. My idea was to go from
point outwards until it reached a coordinate has on it a signature of another
coordinate with the same or equal distance to it, and then to stop calculating
for that point. 
But I got too lazy to implement such a solution so I went for the slow and dumb.

#### Part two
One of the rare times the second one is easier then the first one. Most of the
code from the first one was useless also.
