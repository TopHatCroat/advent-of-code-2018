### Day 8: Memory Maneuver

#### Part one
Treeeeeees! Gotta love that elegant recursion solution.

#### Part two
Why, oh why, do some of these take about a minute to solve, while some others
will leave me banging my head against the wall for 3 hours!

This one was just a slight variation on the first, bit of a different logic
while counting and that's it. Probably could be sped up with some memoisation,
but already quite quick, so why bother.
